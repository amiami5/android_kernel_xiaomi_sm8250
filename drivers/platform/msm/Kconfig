	help
	  Enabling this option adds MSM External Display Driver.
	  External Display driver was added to support the communication
	  between external display driver and its counterparts.
	  This should be enabled to support audio & video over HDMI or
	  DP for hot pluggable sink devices.

	  Say 'y' here to include support for the Qualcomm Technologies, Inc.
	  QPNP REVID peripheral. REVID prints out the PMIC type and revision
	  numbers in the kernel log along with the PMIC option status. The PMIC
	  type is mapped to a QTI chip part number and logged as well.

	help
	  The SPS (Smart Peripheral Switch) is a DMA engine.
	  It can move data in the following modes:
		1. Peripheral-to-Peripheral.
		2. Peripheral-to-Memory.
		3. Memory-to-Memory.

	help
	  The BAM-DMA is used for Memory-to-Memory transfers.
	  The main use cases is RPC between processors.
	  The BAM-DMA hardware has 2 registers sets:
		1. A BAM HW like all the peripherals.
		2. A DMA channel configuration (i.e. channel priority).

config SPS_SUPPORT_NDP_BAM
	bool "SPS support NDP BAM"
	depends on SPS
	default n
	help
	  No-Data-Path BAM is used to improve BAM performance.
	  NDP BAMs enables peripherals with fast fabric connectivity
	  to do the actual data transfer themselves, instead of the
	  BAM.
