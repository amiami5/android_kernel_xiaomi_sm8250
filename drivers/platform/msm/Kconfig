	depends on SPMI
	help
	  Say 'y' here to include support for the Qualcomm Technologies, Inc.
	  QPNP REVID peripheral. REVID prints out the PMIC type and revision
	  numbers in the kernel log along with the PMIC option status. The PMIC
	  type is mapped to a QTI chip part number and logged as well.

config SPS
	bool "SPS support"
	select GENERIC_ALLOCATOR
	help
	  The SPS (Smart Peripheral Switch) is a DMA engine.
	  It can move data in the following modes:
		1. Peripheral-to-Peripheral.
		2. Peripheral-to-Memory.
		3. Memory-to-Memory.

config SPS_SUPPORT_BAMDMA
	bool "SPS support BAM DMA"
	depends on SPS
	default n
	help
	  The BAM-DMA is used for Memory-to-Memory transfers.
	  The main use cases is RPC between processors.
	  The BAM-DMA hardware has 2 registers sets:
		1. A BAM HW like all the peripherals.
		2. A DMA channel configuration (i.e. channel priority).

config SPS_SUPPORT_NDP_BAM
	bool "SPS support NDP BAM"
	depends on SPS
	default n
	help
	  No-Data-Path BAM is used to improve BAM performance.
	  NDP BAMs enables peripherals with fast fabric connectivity
	  to do the actual data transfer themselves, instead of the
	  BAM.

config GSI
	bool "GSI support"
	help
	  This driver provides the transport needed to talk to the
	  IPA core. It replaces the BAM transport used previously.

	  The GSI connects to a peripheral component via uniform TLV
	  interface, and allows it to interface with other peripherals
	  and CPUs over various types of interfaces such as MHI, xDCI,
	  xHCI, GPI, WDI, Ethernet, etc.

config GSI_REGISTER_VERSION_2
	bool "GSI core Version 2 Registers SWI Support"
	depends on GSI
	help
	  GSI core registers Software interface version 2 has updated
	  registers interface to communicate with GSI. This includes
	  new registers offsets, new registers fields structure and
	  new registers.

config IPA3
	tristate "IPA3 support"
	select GSI
	depends on NET
	help
	  This driver supports the Internet Packet Accelerator (IPA3) core.
	  IPA is a programmable protocol processor HW block.
	  It is designed to support generic HW processing of UL/DL IP packets
	  for various use cases independent of radio technology.
	  The driver support client connection and configuration
	  for the IPA core.
	  Kernel and user-space processes can call the IPA driver
	  to configure IPA core.

config IPA_WDI_UNIFIED_API
	bool "IPA WDI unified API support"
	depends on IPA3
	help
	  This driver supports IPA WDI unified API.
	  WDI is the interface between IPA micro controller and WLAN chipset.
	  It is designed to support IPA HW accelerating path for WLAN use case.
	  The IPA WDI unified API supports all WDI versions through a unified
	  interface.

config RMNET_IPA3

	depends on IPA3 && QCOM_QMI_HELPERS
	help
	  This WWAN Network Driver implements network stack class device.
	  It supports Embedded data transfer from A7 to Q6. Configures IPA HW
	  for RmNet Data Driver and also exchange of QMI messages between
	  A7 and Q6 IPA-driver.

config ECM_IPA
	tristate "STD ECM LAN Driver support"
	depends on IPA3
	help
	  Enables LAN between applications processor and a tethered
	  host using the STD ECM protocol.
	  This Network interface is aimed to allow data path go through
	  IPA core while using STD ECM protocol.

config RNDIS_IPA

	depends on IPA3
	help
	  Enables LAN between applications processor and a tethered
	  host using the RNDIS protocol.
	  This Network interface is aimed to allow data path go through
	  IPA core while using RNDIS protocol.

config IPA3_MHI_PROXY
	tristate "IPA3 MHI proxy driver"
	depends on RMNET_IPA3
	help
	  This driver is used as a proxy between modem and MHI host driver.
	  Its main functionality is to setup MHI Satellite channels on behalf of
	  modem and provide the ability of modem to MHI device communication.
	  Once the configuration is done modem will communicate directly with
	  the MHI device without AP involvement, with the exception of
	  power management.

config IPA_UT
	tristate "IPA Unit-Test Framework and Test Suites"
	depends on IPA3 && DEBUG_FS
	help
	  This Module implements IPA in-kernel test framework.
	  The framework supports defining and running tests, grouped
	  into suites according to the sub-unit of the IPA being tested.
	  The user interface to run and control the tests is debugfs file
	  system.

config IPA_EMULATION
	bool "IPA on X86 Linux (IPA emulation support)"
	depends on X86 && IPA3
	help
	  This options is used only when building the X86 version of
	  the IPA/GSI driver. On this mode, IPA driver will be probed
	  as PCIE device (and not platform device) where IPA emulation
	  shall be connected via PCIE to X86 machine.

config USB_BAM
	bool "USB BAM Driver"
	depends on SPS && USB_GADGET
	help
	  Enabling this option adds USB BAM Driver.
